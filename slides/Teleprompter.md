Before we dive into Kubernetes, let's take the time to explore how the infrastructure has evolved.

In the past few years. the industry has experienced a shift towards developing ...

... smaller and more focused applications.

It comes as no surprise that more and more companies are breaking down their apps into a set of decoupled and independent components.

As an example you might refactor a single app into 4 components:
- a single sign-on service
- a backend API
- a front-end
- and a worker that consume messages from a queue.

Apps that are smaller in scope are:
1. Quicker to deploy — because you create and release them in smaller chunks.

2. Easier to iterate on — since adding features happens independently.

3. Resilient — the overall service can still function despite one of the apps not being available.

Smaller services are excellent from a product and development perspective.
But how does that cultural shift impact the infrastructure?
Developing services out of smaller components introduces a different challenge.

Imagine being tasked with migrating a single app into a collection of component...

<!--
3/4
When, for every application, you can refactor the same in a collection of four components, you have three more apps to develop, package and release.

If you want to fully isolate the apps, you need 4x the virtual machines you started with.
But virtual machines have trade-offs.
